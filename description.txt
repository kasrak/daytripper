Day Tripper is a simple web app which builds travel itineraries for spontaneous day trips with a click of a button. Enter in the address of a hotel in a city, and Day Tripper will generate a schedule consisting of popular locations including museums, malls, galleries, and landmarks, complete with breakfast, lunch, and dinner recommendations based on Foursquare data. Each itinerary takes you on a tour around the city with the day starting and ending at your hotel.
